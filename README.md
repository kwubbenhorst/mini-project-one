# Landing Page

A single webpage with header and footer, image, image caption and form to collect a visitor's contact information. Built with HTML and CSS.

## Description

Building this page helped me practice and implement my knowledge of various HTML and CSS features. Various kinds of HTML semantic elements are used including "figure/figcaption" and "form" with the elements "label" and "input" (for Name and Email) and "button."  The CSS uses element and class selectors.  It also uses universal selectors to apply font which I wanted to keep consistent throughout the whole page, and five colour variables. A colour picker was used to match the colours to the ones in the image. The image is described using an alt attribute for accessibility.  h1 and h2 elements are used, observing the convention for hierarchical use of headings. The header contains an inline nav bar, one of which (the contact tab) is a link that scrolls to the (contact) form section of the page. The header is fixed to the top of page on scroll. Mostly the box model and some relative positioning was used to center items on the page. The float and border radius properties were used for positioning nav bar items and rounding corners on the boxes.
